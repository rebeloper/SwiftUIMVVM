# SwiftUIMVVM

I am so excited for you right now!

You have just taken a HUGE step towards finally getting your coding level to where you want it to be.

If you’re tired of throwing spaghetti at the wall for your MVC, not quite sure what you are doing then this tutorial is seriously your saving grace.
This is truly going to be an action-packed training and you’re going to learn how you can use MVVM in SwiftUI. We will talk about MVVM vs MVC, why and when you should use MVVM in SwiftUI. 

And, since this tutorial is going to be so intense (in a good way!), here are a few next steps that I recommend:

First: [Watch the new SwiftUI MVVM tutorial here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhtK_H9LsYQ&list=PL_csAAO9PQ8YzCQmaDdcOc7nLmht69Clz&index=2). 

Second: Download the resources:  https://store.rebeloper.com/youtube-channel-resources

Finally: Do what you can to use Xcode for the Tutorial. Please type the code out as you watch the tutorial. This way it will stick and you will definitely learn it.

Again, a huge congrats to you for taking this step. This truly is going to be a codinglife-changing 20 minutes.

Let’s get to work!
